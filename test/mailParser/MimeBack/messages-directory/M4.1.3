  This character ------->  =D7

  has decimal value > 127. It should only be visible IF you can
  show the character set ISO-8859-7. It should be visible as
  the "GREEK CAPITAL LETTER CHI".

  M4.1.3
       Recognize the "ISO-8859-*" character sets to the extent of being able
       to display those characters that are common to ISO-8859-* and
       US-ASCII, namely all characters represented by octet values 0-127.

       (Interoperability comment: What glyphs to show for octets in the
       range 128-255 is up to the software itself.)
