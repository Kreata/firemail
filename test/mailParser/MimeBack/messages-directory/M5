  M5   
       Upon encountering any unrecognized Content-Type, an implementation
       must treat it as if it had a Content-Type of
       "application/octet-stream" with no parameter sub-arguments. How
       such data are handled is up to an implementation, but likely
       options for handling such unrecognized data include offering the
       user to write it into a file (decoded from its mail transport
       format) or offering the user to name a program to which the
       decoded data should be passed as input. Unrecognized predefined
       types, which in a MIME-conformant mailer might still include
       audio, image, or video, should also be treated in this way.


       This text should be visible after saving the message in a file,
       or whatever. It should NOT be visible without asking the user
       a question about what to do with this unknown content type.
