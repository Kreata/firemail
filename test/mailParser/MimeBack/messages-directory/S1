  S1
       Possibility to send and receive text/plain message types according to
       rule M4.1.1 with the extension that in character set ISO-8859-1
       the octets 128-255 (decimal) must be shown using the correct
       glyphs.

       (Interoperability comment: It is acceptable that some graphical
       symbols are not shown correctly if the reason for that is that no
       mapping table can be done between ISO-8859-1 and the native
       character set which maps 100% of the glyphs.)


       This is swedish characters:

        LATIN CAPITAL LETTER A WITH RING ABOVE     =C5
        LATIN CAPITAL LETTER A WITH DIAERESIS      =C4
        LATIN CAPITAL LETTER O WITH DIAERESIS      =D6
        LATIN CAPITAL LETTER E WITH ACUTE          =C9
        LATIN SMALL LETTER A WITH RING ABOVE       =E5
        LATIN SMALL LETTER A WITH DIAERESIS        =E4
        LATIN SMALL LETTER O WITH DIAERESIS        =F6
        LATIN SMALL LETTER E WITH ACUTE            =E9
