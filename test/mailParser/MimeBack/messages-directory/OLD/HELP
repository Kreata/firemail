To receive a specific MIME-encoded message, put the name by itself
on the subject line of a message to mimetest@imc.org. The body of the

To contact a person about the mimetest suite, send a message to
mimetest-human@imc.org.

The mimetest suite originated with Patrik Fältström.
Patrik handed over control of the suite to IMC in July, 1999.

All messages are tested on several architectures, and on several
MIME clients before they were put in this test suite . Of course,
there may still be errors in the messages. If you think you have
found such errors, please send mail to mimetest-human@imc.org
and let us know.

NOTE: IMC does not take any responsibility for damages on your computer,
your software or loss of work when reading these messages.
You should save your work and quit all other applications before reading a
mimetest message. A message might start an external viewer which crashes
your computer, so even if your mail reader is stable, a crash can still
happen.

You can order the following tests. To request a test, put the name
of the test in the Subject of the request message.
