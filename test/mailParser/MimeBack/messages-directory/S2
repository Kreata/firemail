  S2
       Possibility to send and receive messages which have header lines
       encoded according to RFC-1522 and include the character set
       ISO-8859-1. Recognize other "ISO-8859-*" character sets to the
       extent of being able to display those characters that are common
       to ISO-8859-* and US-ASCII, namely all characters represented by
       octet values 0-127.

  Note that in this mail two things:

   1) My name is in the comment of the From:-line. Exactly
      one space between the given name and the surname.

   2) The subject-line consists of three words. Each word
      is separated from the following one by the two
      characters ',' and ' ', so the Subject should be
     "S2, Faltstrom, Patrik".
