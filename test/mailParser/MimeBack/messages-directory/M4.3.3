Content-Type: multipart/x-foo; boundary=this_is_a_boundary
Subject: M4.3.3

 This is a text which is NOT included in the MIME message.
 Therefore, this text should not be visible for the user.

--this_is_a_boundary
Content-Type: text/plain

  (This is the first part out of two)

  M4.3.3
       Treat any unrecognized subtypes as if they were "mixed".           

--this_is_a_boundary
Content-Type: text/plain

  (This is the second part out of two)

       Note that even though both parts is text/plain, it is
       still two different parts, and this should be visible for
       the user.

       Also, this mail should be visible in the same way as
       4.3.1, even though the multipart subtype is not mixed.

--this_is_a_boundary--
