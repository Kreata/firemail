       (Interopability comment: For maximum usage friendliness, we
       recommend the software to open as few windows as possible, i.e. if
       the software itself can display several different media-types,
       parts made up of these types should be shown together without any
       need for interaction with the user,)

--this_is_a_boundary
Content-Type: text/plain

  (This is the third part out of three)

       Note that even though all three parts is text/plain, it is
       still three different parts, and this should be visible for
       the user.
